        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>
          Thomas, a teenager, arrives in a glade at the center of a giant
          labyrinth. Like the other youths dumped there before him, he has no
          memory of his previous life. Thomas quickly becomes part of the group
          and soon after demonstrates a unique perspective that scores him a
          promotion to Runner status -- those who patrol the always-changing
          maze to find an escape route. Together with Teresa, the only female,
          Thomas tries to convince his cohorts that he knows a way out.
