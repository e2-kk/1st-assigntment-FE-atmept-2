          In the late 1960s and 1970s, fear grips the city of San Francisco as a
          serial killer called Zodiac stalks its residents. Investigators and
          reporters become obsessed with learning the killer's identity and
          bringing him to justice. Meanwhile, Zodiac claims victim after victim
          and taunts the authorities with cryptic messages, cyphers and menacing
          phone calls.
